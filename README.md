# FactionsUI

A very light-weight faction addon plugin that implmenets UIs for each command. This plugin does not add any new features but instead serves as an interface for many of the FactionsPro plugins. This plugin will not be recieving new features. I am just updating it to the current API (without testing) due to a DM.
- Make sure you download all plugins in dependencies folder for this plugin to work.
